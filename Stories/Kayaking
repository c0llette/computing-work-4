My mum and dad love kayaking.

They drag me out of bed every Sunday, just to go for a "casual kayaking adventure"

I never liked it, in fact I hated it. The sea is a scary place. Haven't you heard of people disappearing in the middle of the sea, never to be seen again? Yeah, I hate that.

Nevertheless, I followed my parents again when they requested me to follow them on their "exciting adventure".

The day started out fine, the sky was clear and the wind was a light breeze, making the trees dance along. It seemed like one of those amazing beach movie scenes. 
Of course, the movie in consideration not being Jaws.

We set out 30 minutes ago, and the weather still seems fine.

*Thunder rumbles*

I think that's just Thor being hungry. It's fine.

*Wind intensifies*

"Uh, mum! dad! I think we should head back!"

"It's fine! We're almost at our destination! The lighthouse is just 5 minutes away!"

Well, yes, we were close to the lighthouse. But we could probably seek some shelter at that island which is literally 2 minutes away.

Whatever. They're probably right.

*The boat starts rocking, waves crash around the kayak*

And I scream a little on the outside. Things don't seem to be going well.

*A huge wave approaches*

At this moment Mum and Dad start panicking, and they shout to me,"HOLD ON!!"

I hold on with my life as the boat is devoured by the wave. I shut my eyes tight.

And momentarily, I raise my head above the water to take a peek. I was still holding on to the boat and decide to flip it around, crawling back onto it.

Hold up, where's Mum?? Where's Dad???

Water doesn't fill my lungs, but desperation does, my emotions suffocating me, the wind draining the warmth out of me. 

Another wave approaches.

Is this what happens in the movies?

Maybe my tragedy will be their inspiration.

*2 DAYS LATER*

"Good evening. 2 days ago a thunderstorm was spotted along the coast of the Sounthern beach. It is reported that a family of 3 was last seen kayaking within that area.
However, unfortunately, the authorities have failed to locate their bodies. They will continue to do so. If you have seen the family, please contact 999 immediately.
Our deepest condolences go out to those who know the family."

Approximately 10 kilometres from Southern beach, a body was washed ashore on a tiny island.
